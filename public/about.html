<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Ognjen Sovilj, student of Applied Software Engineering at Faculty of
  Technical Science.<br />
  I see myself as a hard-working and flexible person willing to learn new skills
  everyday to improve myself professionally but also as a person.<br />
  I'm a good listener and quick learner, able to communicate well with members
  of my team.<br />
  I am well organized and always plan ahead to make sure I manage my time well.
  I'll conclude this section with my favorite quote that guides me: “<b
    >Everything that you do, do it the best you can</b
  >”
